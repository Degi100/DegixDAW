# DegixDAW Desktop

Electron/Tauri desktop application for DegixDAW with native DAW integration.

## Features (Planned)

- Native desktop integration
- VST plugin hosting
- DAW protocol integration (ReWire, VST3, AAX)
- Low-latency audio processing
- File system access for project management
- System tray integration

## Tech Stack (To Be Decided)

### Option 1: Electron
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, web tech reuse, extensive plugin support
- **Cons**: Large bundle size, higher memory usage

### Option 2: Tauri
- **Pros**: Smaller bundle, lower memory usage, Rust backend
- **Cons**: Younger ecosystem, less plugin support
